## Project 1: BG Fashion Financial Report (POWER BI)
 Data Visualisation, Data Cleaning, Data Validation and structuring
 Tools: Power BI, Excel, Python (Pandas), SQL, DAX POWER BI. 
## ![BG Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d42f9b6-50b8-4841-baa2-24f668096e82)

This dashboard provides a high-level, real-time overview of national sales performance across territories and brands. Here‚Äôs my process:

* Cleaned and structured raw data using Excel and Python (Pandas) for consistency and accuracy.
* Performed data validation using SQL queries to cross-check and confirm critical figures.
* Created dynamic DAX measures in Power BI to calculate KPIs such as total sales, brand performance, and territory breakdowns.
* Visualised key metrics including competitive vs. non-competitive sales, store distribution by state, and brand contributions.
* Designed the dashboard focusing on clarity and usability, enabling quick, data-driven decisions for executives.
* Empowered the CEO with an at-a-glance view of national sales performance, helping identify growth opportunities and underperforming regions.

# Project 2: Regional Sales Dashboard(EXCEL)
* Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation and Reporting
* Tools: Excel, Python, PowerPoint) 
## ![Regional sales Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/154eb9d3-e56c-4e4d-87f3-3267c967169d)

This project offers a clear visual of sales performance across different regions, products, and sales representatives. Designed to support regional managers and business leaders with strategic sales insights.

What I Did:
* Cleaned and prepared the dataset in Excel, ensuring data types, product categories, and regional mappings were accurate.
* Built custom DAX measures in Power BI to track performance against monthly targets and calculate KPIs like revenue per region and top sales reps.
* Used slicers for interactive filtering by region and product category, allowing users to drill down into specific views.
* Visualised key trends and made use of Microsoft PowerPoint for further data reporting - [CaseStudyA_Toluwanimi_Odusanya.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20225566/CaseStudyA_Toluwanimi_Odusanya.pptx)
* Designed the dashboard layout for clarity and quick comparisons between regional performance metrics.

 ## Project 3: Daily Fitness Tracker Analysis - PYTHON
* Data Cleaning & Visualisation
* Tools ‚Äì Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

‚úÖ What I Did:
Imported and cleaned the dataset using Pandas for consistent formatting and accurate numerical types.

Used groupby() and aggregation techniques to explore relationships between activity duration and vital signs.

Plotted histograms of multiple variables (Duration, Pulse, Maxpulse, and Calories) using Matplotlib subplots for side-by-side analysis.

Used subplots=True to display multiple insights at once, improving comparative visualization and readability.

üìå Key Insights & Value Delivered
üìà Workout Duration shows a fairly consistent calorie burn range, indicating moderate intensity across sessions.

‚ù§Ô∏è Pulse and Maxpulse distributions reveal the exertion levels of different users, helpful in setting fitness targets.

üî• The Calories histogram reveals clusters of energy expenditure, helping in designing tailored workout plans.

üß† Enabled quick visual inspection of fitness variables to identify irregularities or patterns in user performance.

üìä Created an accessible and modular plotting script that can be applied to any personal fitness dataset for future analysis.
