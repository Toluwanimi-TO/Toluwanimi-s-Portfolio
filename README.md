## ![BG Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d42f9b6-50b8-4841-baa2-24f668096e82)

This dashboard provides a high-level, real-time overview of national sales performance across territories and brands. Hereâ€™s my process:

* Cleaned and structured raw data using Excel and Python (Pandas) for consistency and accuracy.
* Performed data validation using SQL queries to cross-check and confirm critical figures.
* Created dynamic DAX measures in Power BI to calculate KPIs such as total sales, brand performance, and territory breakdowns.
* Visualised key metrics including competitive vs. non-competitive sales, store distribution by state, and brand contributions.
* Designed the dashboard focusing on clarity and usability, enabling quick, data-driven decisions for executives.
* Empowered the CEO with an at-a-glance view of national sales performance, helping identify growth opportunities and underperforming regions.

Tools: Power BI, Excel, Python (Pandas), SQL, DAX
